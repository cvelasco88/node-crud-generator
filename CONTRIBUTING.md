### Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please look at any existing issues. If one doesn't exist, follow these guidelines:

* Describe the bug in detail whilst keeping it succinct
* Include any errors, stack traces or output
* Instructions for reproducing the bug, if relevant
* Submitting a Pull Request for the bug is helpful to everyone. The issue can be solved faster and more people become familiar with the code. All existing tests must pass on Pull Requests and any new tests must be supplied

### Code style

* Tabs not spaces
* No trailing whitespace
* Variables defined on separate lines. No comma-separated variables.
* Inline documentation for methods

### Running Tests

Tests are created using [mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/) and [should.js](https://github.com/tj/should.js).

Run tests with `npm test`
